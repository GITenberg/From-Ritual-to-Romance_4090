description: "From Ritual to Romance is a 1920 book written by Jessie L. Weston. The\
  \ work is notable for being mentioned by T. S. Eliot in the notes to his poem, The\
  \ Waste Land:\n\nNot only the title, but the plan and a good deal of the incidental\
  \ symbolism of the poem were suggested by Miss Jessie L. Weston's book.\n\nWeston's\
  \ book is an academic examination of the roots of the King Arthur legends and seeks\
  \ to make connections between the early pagan elements and the later Christian influences.\
  \ The book's main focus is on the Holy Grail tradition and its influence, particularly\
  \ the Wasteland motif. The origins of Weston's book are in James George Frazer's\
  \ seminal work on folklore, magic and religion, The Golden Bough (1890), and in\
  \ the works of Jane Ellen Harrison.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
